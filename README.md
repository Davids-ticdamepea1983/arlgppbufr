iHostage. Wow. I honestly don’t even know where to start with this. Ever feel like you've just been emotionally wrestled, and not in the fun WWE way, but the kind where you're just kinda tired after? Yep, that’s me right now. Came outta the theater a mixture of confused and, somehow, slightly miffed — like the   just whispered “gotcha” and punched me in the brain.

First things first, the plot. Or at least, the thing pretending to be a plot. A high-stakes hostage situation, they said! And I guess that was an accurate description technically, but man, if only they added “bizarre character decisions” and “dialogue straight out of a high school play” to the description, I might’ve been prepared. So there they were, awkward teenagers (who looked like they've been in dodgeball class for 53 years) navigating a terrorist scenario while managing personal drama. Who knew crying your eyes out could become your new cardio after 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a thriller. 

> And the main villain, oh boy. He was like a goth supermarket manager — that guy you think will just check your groceries but ends up plotting your emotional meltdown instead. I've seen AI scripts more coherent than his evil plan. But, hey, it's 2023, we applaud effort now, right?

That moment when the protagonist's phone battery died? Classic. Not dramatic nor tension-filled, just painfully relatable. Might as well have been an advert for those portable phone chargers — miss me with that advertisement nonsense. Or 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and see for yourself; it’s like waiting for a bus that never turns up.

And let's not forget the special effects. I don’t know if they were intentionally going for a retro '90s look, but someone should tell them that we’ve seen actual fireworks, and their pixel explosions ain't fooling anyone. It was like trying to resurrect the Millennium Bug using GarageBand sound effects. No thanks, I’m full.

```javascript
function releaseTheHostage() {
   if (villain.monologue) {
      hero.escapePlan(); 
   }
}
```

Anyway, if you're into inexplicable character arcs and what I presume is an improv-trained cast trying their best, maybe, just maybe, give it a go. Or better yet, save your energy and take a nap instead — might get more out of it. I guess maybe I should give it another 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 on a better day. Or not. Movie's gotta do more than drag me through scene after scene of “what’s happening?” moments, right? Maybe I'll stick to cat videos for my dose of thrilling narrative next time.
